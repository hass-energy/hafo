# HAFO Config Packages

This folder contains YAML packages for HAFO testing and development.

Each subfolder can contain YAML files that will be merged into the main
Home Assistant configuration. This is useful for testing different
configurations and integrations locally.

See the
[Home Assistant packages documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/)
for more information.
